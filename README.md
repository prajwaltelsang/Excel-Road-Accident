# Excel-Road-Accident
Project: Road Accident Data Analysis (Data Visualization) 
Objective: The main objective of creating this dashboard is to track and analyze the reasons for Road Accidents
# Insights:
1. **Total Casualties**:
   - The dashboard shows a total of 417,883 casualties.

2. **Casualties by Severity**:
   - Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)
   - Serious Casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)
   - Slight Casualties: 35,143 (84.1%)

3. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**:
   - Cars account for the majority of casualties at 333,485.
   - Motorcycles, bicycles, and buses also contribute to casualties but to a much lesser extent.

4. **Casualties by Road Type**:
   - Single carriageways have the highest number of casualties (309.7K).
   - Dual carriageways, roundabouts, and one-way streets have significantly fewer casualties.

5. **Casualties by Road Surface**:
   - Most casualties occurred on dry surfaces (279,445), followed by wet surfaces (115,261), and snow-covered surfaces (22,781).

6. **Casualties by Area**:
   - Rural areas see more casualties (255.9K) compared to urban areas (162.0K).

7. **Casualties by Light Conditions**:
   - Most casualties happen in daylight (305.0K), with fewer in dark conditions (112.9K).

8. **Monthly Trend**:
   - There is a notable monthly variation in casualties, with peaks observed around mid-year months.

#### Predictions:

1. **Future Casualty Trends**:
   - The trend of higher casualties in mid-year months is likely to continue, suggesting a need for heightened awareness and safety measures during this period.
   
2. **Vehicle Type Focus**:
   - Cars will continue to be the primary vehicle type involved in accidents. Strategies to enhance car safety and driver education can potentially reduce these numbers.
   
3. **Road Type and Surface**:
   - Single carriageways and dry surfaces will remain the most common settings for accidents. Improving infrastructure and road safety measures in these areas could mitigate risks.

#### Suggestions:

1. **Enhance Road Safety on Single Carriageways**:
   - Given the high number of casualties on single carriageways, it is crucial to implement safety measures such as better signage, speed limits, and road maintenance.

2. **Focus on Rural Areas**:
   - Since rural areas see more casualties, targeted interventions like improving road conditions, increasing patrols, and educating drivers in these areas could be beneficial.

3. **Increase Safety Campaigns During Mid-Year Months**:
   - With the mid-year months showing higher casualty rates, launching safety campaigns and awareness programs during this period can help reduce accidents.

4. **Promote Daylight Safety**:
   - Although most casualties occur in daylight, this indicates high traffic volume during these hours. Promoting safe driving practices and enforcing traffic rules during the day can be effective.

5. **Improve Car Safety**:
   - Since cars are the major contributors to casualties, improving vehicle safety standards, promoting regular maintenance, and encouraging the use of advanced safety features can reduce accident rates.
